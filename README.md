# line2d_ros
This repo consists of the ROS version of 3 learning-based 2D line segment detecton algorithm (AFM, HAWP, and ULSD). Currently, all the pacakges are tested on ROS melodic and python 2.7. pytorch version is 1.3.1. 

* AFM: Nan Xue, Song Bai, Fudong Wang, Gui-Song Xia, Tianfu Wu, Liangpei Zhang. Learning Attraction Field Representation for Robust Line Segment Detection. CVPR 2019
* HAWP: Nan Xue, Tianfu Wu, Song Bai, Fudong Wang, Gui-Song Xia, Liangpei Zhang, Philip H.S. Torr. Holistically-Attracted Wireframe Parsing. CVPR 2020
* ULSD: Hao Li, Huai Yu, Jinwang Wang, Wen Yang, Lei Yu, Sebastian Scherer. Unified line segment detection across pinhole, fisheye, and spherical cameras. ISPRS 2021

# Note
Since the ros version is for testing on continuous video frames, the runing frequency is different from what the papes claim.
